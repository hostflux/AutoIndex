## AutoIndex PHP Script (version 2.2.4)

### by Justin Hagstrom
AutoIndex is provided under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

This is a GitHub copy of the code from [https://autoindex.sourceforge.net](https://autoindex.sourceforge.net). The project was last updated in 2007 and relies on PHP which is no longer maintained. Since PHP 5 is no longer maintained by the PHP team, this project is considered deprecated and no longer supported.

To install and run the script, simply upload the contents of this directory to a server with PHP support (**PHP 5** is required).

Then, point your browser to the index.php file in that folder. The first time you do this, it will take you to a configuration page.

To use all the default values, just click the button at the bottom, or customize it however you want.
